      <h2>Superman</h2>
      <p>Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive… The Man of Steel fights a never-ending battle
        for truth, justice, and the American way.</p>
      <p>From his blue uniform to his flowing red cape to the "S" shield on his chest, Superman is one of the most
        immediately recognizable and beloved DC Super Heroes of all time. The Man of Steel is the ultimate symbol of
        truth, justice, and hope. He is the world's first Super Hero and a guiding light to all. The tip of the spear in
        a revolution that would change the landscape of pop culture, Superman has spent the last
        eighty years redefining what it means to stand for truth, justice and the American way. The last survivor of the
        doomed planet Krypton, raised in the quiet heartland of Smallville, Kansas, Superman is as much a legend as he
        is a man: the gold standard of heroism, compassion and responsibility.
        Though his powers make him god-like next to his human compatriots, Superman's story is not one of greed or
        conquest. Instead, he strives to represent the inherent goodness of the human spirit, and the capacity of every
        living thing to do right by their neighbors.</p>

      <h2>Batman</h2>
      <p>In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is
        vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.
        One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a
        war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child.
        Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super
        Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of
        his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated. A playboy
        billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial
        worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath
        his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and
        pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.

      <h2>Wonder Woman</h2>
      <p>Beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, swifter than Hermes, and stronger than Hercules, Princess Diana of
        Themyscira fights for peace in Man's World.</p>
      <p>One of the most beloved and iconic DC Super Heroes of all time, Wonder Woman has stood for nearly eighty years
        as a symbol of truth, justice and equality to people everywhere. Raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, also
        known as Paradise Island, Diana is an Amazon, like the figures of Greek legend, and her people's gift to
        humanity.
        As Themyscira's emissary to Man's World, Diana has made it her duty to lead by example, even if the differences
        between her birthplace and new home sometimes present hurdles for her to jump. She has come to represent the
        possibility and potential of life without war, hate or violence, and she is a beacon of hope to all who find
        themselves in need. She stands as an equal among the most powerful Super Heroes, with a sense of purpose to
        protect the world from injustice in all forms.</p>
