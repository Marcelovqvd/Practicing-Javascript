      <h2>Machiavelli</h2>
      <img src="img/machiavelli.jpg" alt="Machiavelli">
      <p>Living during the Italian Renaissance, Machiavelli is famous for his contributions to political philosophy. His
        book “The Prince” explains to rulers how they can stay in power at all costs. This book shocked people because
        before that time, everyone thought rulers were (or should be) virtuous. He claimed that, “Might makes right,”
        and “It is better to be feared than loved.”</p>

      <h2>kant</h2>
      <img src="img/kant.jpg" alt="kant">
      <p>Born in Germany, Kant is well known for his ideas about perception. He argued that we cannot know what the
        world is really like (noumenal world). We can only know what we perceive the world to be like (phenomenal
        world). Basically, we can’t know whether or not everything is just one big Matrix.</p>

    <section class="js-scroll" id="spinoza">
      <h2>Spinoza</h2>
      <img src="img/Spinoza.jpg" alt="Spinoza">
      <p>Spinoza was a Jewish philosopher born in Amsterdam during the 1600’s. He is famous for intellectualizing many
        parts of the Judeo-Christian belief system. For example, he argued that the miracles were not supernatural. Many
        of these beliefs got him in trouble with the authorities.</p>
